    'chest': 'Place the measuring tape around the fullest part of the bust. Make sure the measuring tape is straight all the way around the chest and back.',
    'belowChestWait': 'Take this measurement just above the waist below the bust. This is where the blouse will end. Be sure to measure all the way around.',
    'tuckPoint': 'Start at the top of the shoulder at the neck point to the bust. Make sure the measuring tape is straight all the way around the chest',
    'armHole': 'Keep arms relaxed by your side. Place the measuring tape at the top of the shoulder in line with your armpit. Wrap the tape inder the arm and over the end of your shoulder to the straight point. The tape measure should feel snug but not tight.',
    'shoulder':'Place the measuring tape across the back and measure in a straight line from the end of the left shoulder to the end of the right shoulder',
    'sleeveLength':'If you are getting a sleeveless blouse you can skip this step. Place the measuring tape at the edge of the shoulder. Measure down the arm from there until you have the desired sleeve length.',
    'blouseLength':'Start at the center of the shoulder and draw the measuring tape straight down to the point where you want your blouse to end. Make sure that the tape passes over the center of the bust when taking this measurement.',
    'hips': 'Measure the circumference of your hips. Start at one hip and wrap the tape measure around your rear, around the other hip, and back to where you started. Make sure the tape is over the largest part of your buttocks. Because making sure the tape is level back there can be hard, try to do it in front of a mirror.',
    'waist':'Measure the circumference of your waist. Use the tape to circle your waist (sort of like a belt would) at your natural waistline, which is located above your belly button and below your rib cage. (If you bend to the side, the crease that forms is your natural waistline.) Don’t suck in your stomach, or you’ll get a false measurement. If you generally wear your clothes below your waist, take that measurement as well.',
    'Empty':'As per requirement'
